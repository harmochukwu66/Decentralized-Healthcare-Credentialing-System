# Decentralized Healthcare Credentialing System

A blockchain-based solution for managing healthcare provider credentials using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

The Decentralized Healthcare Credentialing System provides a transparent, immutable, and secure way to manage healthcare provider credentials on the blockchain. This system eliminates the need for repetitive credential verification across healthcare organizations, reduces administrative overhead, and prevents credential fraud.

## Features


- **Provider Identity Management**: Secure digital identities for healthcare practitioners
- **Qualification Verification**: Immutable record of medical degrees and training
- **License Status Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of professional license status
- **Facility Privileging**: Streamlined management of clinical privileges across institutions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Specific permissions for regulators, verifiers, and administrators
- **Transparent History**: Complete audit trail of all credential changes

## Architecture

The system consists of four main smart contracts that work together to provide a comprehensive credentialing solution:

## Smart Contracts

### Provider Identity Contract

Manages healthcare practitioner identities with the following features:
- Registration of provider profiles
- Storage of professional information (name, specialty, NPI number)
- Status tracking (active/inactive)
- Principal to provider ID mapping

### Qualification Verification Contract

Validates and stores information about medical degrees and training:
- Records qualifications with issuing institutions
- Tracks issue and expiration dates
- Implements verification by authorized entities
- Maintains qualification lists per provider

### License Status Contract

Tracks the active/suspended status of professional licenses:
- Stores license information (type, number, issuing authority)
- Manages license status (active, suspended, revoked, expired)
- Implements regulatory oversight
- Provides real-time status verification

### Facility Privileging Contract

Manages approved procedures by institution:
- Registers healthcare facilities
- Tracks clinical privileges granted to providers
- Stores procedure codes and descriptions
- Manages privilege status changes

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) installed
- Basic knowledge of Clarity and Stacks blockchain

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-credentialing.git
   cd healthcare-credentialing
```

2. Initialize the Clarinet project (if not already initialized):

```shellscript
clarinet new
```


3. Copy the contract files to the contracts directory:

```shellscript
cp contracts/* /path/to/clarinet/project/contracts/
```


4. Run the tests:

```shellscript
npm test
```




## Usage

### Deploying the Contracts

1. Deploy the contracts using Clarinet:

```shellscript
clarinet deploy
```


2. Interact with the contracts using the Clarinet console:

```shellscript
clarinet console
```




### Example Interactions

#### Registering a Provider

```plaintext
(contract-call? .provider-identity register-provider 
  "provider-123" 
  "Dr. Jane Smith" 
  "Cardiology" 
  "1234567890"
)
```

#### Adding a Qualification

```plaintext
(contract-call? .qualification-verification add-qualification 
  "qual-123" 
  "provider-123" 
  "Medical Degree" 
  "Harvard Medical School" 
  "Doctor of Medicine" 
  u1609459200 
  u1735689600
)
```

#### Registering a License

```plaintext
(contract-call? .license-status register-license 
  "license-123" 
  "provider-123" 
  "Medical License" 
  "MD12345" 
  "State Medical Board" 
  u1609459200 
  u1735689600
)
```

#### Granting a Privilege

```plaintext
(contract-call? .facility-privileging grant-privilege 
  "privilege-123" 
  "provider-123" 
  "facility-123" 
  "SURG001" 
  "Appendectomy" 
  u1735689600
)
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all contracts using Vitest. Run the tests with:

```shellscript
npm test
```

The tests cover:

- Provider registration and management
- Qualification addition and verification
- License registration and status updates
- Facility registration and privilege management


## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: All contracts implement strict access control to ensure only authorized entities can perform sensitive operations
- **Data Validation**: Input validation is performed to prevent invalid data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and messages for debugging
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, credential data cannot be deleted, only updated with a full audit trail


## Future Enhancements

- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) standards
- Implementation of zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Cross-chain interoperability for broader adoption
- Mobile application for credential holders
